                <h1 class="who"><b>Who is Raheel Bayat?</b></h1>
            </div>
            <div class="about-square-1">
                <p class="Moarifi">Raheel Bayat is a medical student at Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), located in Tehran, Iran.
                    She was born in Kabul, Afghanistan in 1999, to Mohammad Jaweed Bayat and Munira Bayat. Raheel has three sisters and one brother: Dr. Aqdas Bayat, Mohammad Azim Bayat, Author Zahra Bayat, and Hajar Bayat.
                    Raheel began her primary education in 2007 (1385) and graduated from high school in 2018 (1397). Following her graduation, she immediately pursued a Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree at Khatam Al-Nabieen University in 2019 (1398). From the beginning, she was deeply passionate about medicine and committed herself to achieving her goals.
                    However, after the return of the Taliban regime, Raheel-along with countless other Afghan girls-was forcibly banned from continuing her education. Like millions of girls across the country, she was confined to her home, denied her basic rights, and faced immense pressure from cultural and political oppression, including the threat of early marriage. While many young women lost hope-some even resorting to suicide-Raheel refused to surrender. Instead, she entered the world of research, applied for scholarships, and tirelessly pursued new opportunities. Among her many efforts, she was accepted at TUMS to study medicine once again-proving that destiny, perseverance, and faith can overcome even the harshest obstacles.
                    Raheel bravely challenged deeply rooted societal beliefs, ultimately convincing her family and community to support her dream of continuing her education. Today, she is not only a dedicated MD student, but also an active researcher, web designer, and a speaker for USERN Mtalks.
                    Although she faces the emotional and practical challenges of living alone in a foreign country, she remains committed to improving her skills, fulfilling the goals she has set for herself, and walking the path that Allah (S.W.T.) has written in her destiny.

                <h1 class="who">Why Raheel is so passionate about medicine?</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="about-square-2">
                <p class="medicine">Raheel‚Äôs passion for medicine stems from a deep-rooted desire to serve humanity and bring healing to those in need, especially the underserved and vulnerable. Growing up in Afghanistan, she witnessed firsthand the devastating effects of inadequate healthcare, particularly on women and children. These early experiences ignited a powerful sense of responsibility in her to pursue a field where she could make a meaningful difference. For Raheel, medicine is not just a profession; it is a mission to restore dignity, relieve suffering, and advocate for those who are often silenced by societal and political barriers. Her personal journey, shaped by adversity and the fight for education under oppressive regimes, has only strengthened her resolve. She sees medicine as a powerful tool-not only to treat physical illnesses-but to bring hope, inspire change, and empower others to rise above their circumstances.</p>

                <p><b>Raheel Bayat</b>"I have made a personal commitment to embrace and experience every opportunity that comes my way-whether big or small-because I believe that each moment holds the potential to help me grow, evolve, and become the person I am meant to be. My goal is not just personal achievement, but to develop myself in every possible way, to honor the gifts my Lord has given me, and to live up to the purpose. He has written for me. I believe that every cell in my body, every breath I take, and every bit of energy I carry is a trust (Amanat) that I must use wisely. I will continue striving not for perfection, but for the progress that reflects the effort, intention, and sincerity my Creator expects from me. This journey is sacred, and I am ready to walk it with dedication, faith, and full presence. Remember that it is what I expect from every human being, including my siblings!</p>
