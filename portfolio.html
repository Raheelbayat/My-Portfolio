            <p><b class="subtitle-of-almond-article">Aim and Background:</b> Learning and memory are fundamental processes essential to human cognition. 
            Memory disorders can greatly impact cognitive abilities and overall quality of life. Synthetic drugs are not always completely effective in the 
            treatment of memory disorders and can have diverse side effects. As a result, the use of plants for treating various diseases, including those 
            related to memory disorders, is common. Almond is a highly nutritious nut and has been used as a traditional remedy for a long time. They 
            contain active compounds that have numerous biological effects on the entire body, particularly the nervous system. Therefore, the purpose 
            of this study is to review animal studies that have investigated the effects of almond intake on memory and its related disorders.</p>

            <p><b class="subtitle-of-almond-article">Methods:</b> In this study, a comprehensive search in several databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, and 
            Cochrane Library was performed. The study included published articles featuring preclinical studies conducted on healthy animals or 
            models with memory impairments. These studies employed specific controlled groups and evaluated memory-related parameters 
            through behavioral tests or molecular investigations. Eleven original papers that met the criteria were selected from a total of 1190 
            identified articles and included in the study.</p>
            
            <p><b class="subtitle-of-almond-article">Results:</b> Almond consumption has been shown to have beneficial effects on learning and memory in healthy animals. Additionally, 
            evidence suggests that consuming almonds can positively impact scopolamine-, cadmium-, chronic stress-, and high-fat diet-induced 
            memory impairment in animal models.</p>

            <p><b class="subtitle-of-almond-article">Conclusion:</b> Based on available evidence, consuming dietary supplementation of almonds may have a significant role in brain 
            processes, specifically the neuromodulatory systems. Consequently, incorporating almonds into one’s diet could potentially enhance 
            memory function, making them a readily available and useful natural resource with both nutritional and therapeutic benefits.</p>

            <p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as Nettle, has a long-standing history in traditional medicine and has been
                recognized for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Recent studies have explored its potential as
                a promising treatment for type 2 diabetes, a condition characterized by hyperglycemia, chronic inflammation,
                and oxidative stress. These underlying mechanisms contribute to the development of neurologic
                complications. It has been established in several animal studies that nettle can exert significant
                neuroprotective effects in diabetic models, reducing its neurologic complications such as cognitive
                impairment, affective disorders, and peripheral neuropathy. However, despite this promising preclinical
                evidence, a comprehensive assessment of the quality of evidence supporting the neuroprotective effects of
                Urtica dioica in diabetes is lacking. Although a narrative review article has been published on the
                neuroprotective effects of Urtica dioica, it is not a systematic review and does not specifically focus on
                diabetic subjects. This systematic review aims to critically evaluate the quality of evidence on the efficacy of
                Urtica dioica in reducing neurologic complications of diabetes and exerting neuroprotective effects in diabetic
                animal models to enable the transition to clinical research. The review will focus on studies that have
                investigated the effects of Urtica dioica on neurologic complications in diabetic animal models, as well as the
                underlying mechanisms of these effects. The review emphasizes the need for continued investigation to
                bridge the gap between preclinical findings and clinical application, ultimately paving the way for potential
                therapeutic applications of Urtica dioica in the prevention and management of diabetic complications.</p>

        <div id="text3"><p>Walnut (Juglans regia L.) is a medicinal plant rich in bioactive peptides, known for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and gut microbiota-modulating properties. Emerging research suggests that these peptides may help mitigate cognitive dysfunction in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases by influencing the gut-brain axis. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, are characterized by progressive neuronal loss, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress, ultimately leading to cognitive decline. While promising preclinical evidence supports the neuroprotective effects of walnut peptides and their influence on gut microbiota, a comprehensive evaluation of the quality of this evidence remains lacking. Although existing reviews have explored the effects of walnuts and walnut peptides on cognitive dysfunction, none have systematically examined their role in gut-brain axis modulation as an underlying mechanism. This systematic review aims to critically assess the available evidence on the cognitive benefits of walnut peptides, with a particular emphasis on their mechanisms of action via the gut-brain axis. It will examine studies conducted in animal models of cognitive impairment, highlighting both observed effects and underlying biological pathways. Emphasizing the need for further investigation, this review seeks to bridge the gap between preclinical findings and clinical application, paving the way for potential therapeutic uses of walnut peptides in the prevention and management of cognitive disorders.</p></div>
